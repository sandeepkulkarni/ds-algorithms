/**
 Arrays. sort(Object[]) is based on the 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭 algorithm
 Time complexity - O(n log(n)).

 What is 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭?
 - It's a sorting algorithm based on Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.
 - A stable sorting algorithm works in O(n log(n)) time
 - Used in Java’s Arrays.sort() as well as Python’s sorted() and sort().
 - Logic -> First sort small pieces using Insertion Sort, then merges the pieces using a merge of merge sort.
