 371. Sum of Two Integers

 Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

 Example:
 Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Approach:

     "&" AND operation, for example, 2 (0010) & 7 (0111) => 2 (0010)

     "^" XOR operation, for example, 2 (0010) ^ 7 (0111) => 5 (0101)

     "~" NOT operation, for example, ~2(0010) => -3 (1101) what??? Don't get frustrated here. It's called two's complement.

     1111 is -1, in two's complement
     1110 is -2, which is ~2 + 1, ~0010 => 1101, 1101 + 1 = 1110 => 2
     1101 is -3, which is ~3 + 1

     so if you want to get a negative number, you can simply do ~x + 1

    1. For this, problem, for example, we have a = 1, b = 3,
    2. In bit representation, a = 0001, b = 0011,
    3. First, we can use "and"("&") operation between a and b to find a carry.
    4. carry = a & b, then carry = 0001
    5. Second, we can use "xor" ("^") operation between a and b to find the different bit, and assign it to a,
    6. Then, we shift carry one position left and assign it to b, b = 0010.
    Iterate until there is no carry (or b == 0)
