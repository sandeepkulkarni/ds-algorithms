    /**
     10 is the product of 2 and 5. In n!, we need to know how many 2 and 5, and the number of zeros is the minimum of the number of 2 and the number of 5.

     Since multiple of 2 is more than multiple of 5, the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5.
     Here we expand:

     2147483647!
     =2 * 3 * ...* 5 ... *10 ... 15* ... * 25 ... * 50 ... * 125 ... * 250...
     =2 * 3 * ...* 5 ... * (5^1*2)...(5^1*3)...*(5^2*1)...*(5^2*2)...*(5^3*1)...*(5^3*2)... (Equation 1)
     We just count the number of 5 in Equation 1.

     Multiple of 5 provides one 5, multiple of 25 provides two 5 and so on.

     Note the duplication: multiple of 25 is also multiple of 5, so multiple of 25 only provides one extra 5.

     Here is the basic solution:
     return n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + n/625 + n/3125+...;
     You can easily rewrite it to a loop.

     So we have as many zeros as multiple of 5
     As n reduces by 5 each iteration: Complexity log5(N) - base 5

    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int zeros = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            zeros += n/5;           //as many zeros as multiple of 5
            n = n/5;                //n reduces by 5 each iteration: Complexity log5(N) - base 5
        }
        return zeros;
    }
