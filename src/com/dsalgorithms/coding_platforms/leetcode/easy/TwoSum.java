/**
1. Two Sum
 https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific
target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
UPDATE (2016/2/13):
The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naive Approach:
Outer loop and inner loop to check each number with every other number to see if matches target.
Complexity: O(n^2)

Optimised Approach:
	1. HashMap to store <Target - Num, Num index> and check while inserting num if diff is 0
	2. If diff = 0, get previous value index and current value index and return
