/**
 191. Number of 1 Bits
 https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

 Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should
 return 3.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach:
 1. n & n-1   i.e set the right most bit to 0
 2. increment counter till n != 0

                            //and the code would not enter the while if the condition is n>0 for n=2147483648.
