 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

 Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should
 become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

 IMP: You are given only access to that node, You don't have access to head of list
