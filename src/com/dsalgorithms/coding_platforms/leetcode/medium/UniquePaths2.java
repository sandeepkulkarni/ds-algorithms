 63. Unique Paths II
 Follow up for "Unique Paths":

 Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

 An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

 For example,
 There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

 [
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]
 ]
 The total number of unique paths is 2.

 Note: m and n will be at most 100.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Approach:
    1. Same DP formula but if Obstacle present then T[i][j] = 0
    2. Trick here is filling the initial row and column to 1. Fill 1 only till there is no obstacle, as you can go till there
        After obstacle break, i.e keep it 0 as you cannot reach if there is obstacle

 eg. {  {0,0},
        {1,1},
        {0,0} };
  then initial row and column will be
        1  1
        0  0
        0  0    <- this cannot be reached as obstacle in middle, so break and don't fill it with 1.
