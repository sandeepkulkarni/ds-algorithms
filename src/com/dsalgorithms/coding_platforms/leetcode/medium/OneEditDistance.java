 * Question:
 Given two strings S and T, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.
 Hint:
 1. If | n – m | is greater than 1, we know immediately both are not one-edit distance apart.
 2. It might help if you consider these cases separately, m == n and m ≠ n.
 3. Assume that m is always ≤ n, which greatly simplifies the conditional statements. If m > n, we could just simply swap S and T.
 4. If m == n, it becomes finding if there is exactly one modified operation.
    If m ≠ n, you do not have to consider the delete operation. Just consider the insert operation in T.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Approach:
 1. This is special case of general Edit distance problem which is solved by DP in O(mn) time and O(mn) space
 2. As we have to check only 1-edit distance, we can loop once concurrently and check if Add/Modify/Delete have to be done for 1 char
 3. Assume m <= n, else just swap S and T
 4. Handle - Add/Append, Modify, Delete operations correctly - all cases

    Append case: If S matches all characters in T, then check if there is an extra character at the end of T
    Modify case: If | n – m | == 1, that means we must skip this non-matching character only in T
                 and make sure the remaining characters between S and T are exactly matching.
    Delete case: If | n – m | == 0, then we skip both non-matching characters in S and T and make
                 sure the remaining characters between S and T are exactly matching.
