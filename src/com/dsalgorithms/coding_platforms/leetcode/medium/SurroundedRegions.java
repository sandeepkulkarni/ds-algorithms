 130. Surrounded Regions

 Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

 A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

 For example,
 X X X X
 X O O X
 X X O X
 X O X X
 After running your function, the board should be:

 X X X X
 X X X X
 X X X X
 X O X X

     The idea is pretty simple: a 'O' marked cell cannot be captured (converted to X) when:

     1. It is in on the border of the board or
     2. It is adjacent to an unflippable cell (U).

     So the algorithm is straightforward:

     1. Go around the border of the board
        When a 'O' cell is found mark it with 'U' and perform a DFS on its adjacent cells looking for other 'O' marked cells.

     2. Postprocessing step: When the entire border is processed scan again the board
         If a cell is marked as 'O' it wasn't connected to unflippable cell. Hence capture/convert it to 'X'
         If a cell is marked as 'X' nothing must be done.
         If a cell is marked as 'U' mark it as 'O' because it was an original 'O' marked cell which satisfied one of the above conditions.
