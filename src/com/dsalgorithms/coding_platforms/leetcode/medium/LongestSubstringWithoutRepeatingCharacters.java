 * 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 Examples:

 Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

 Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

 APPROACH 1: Sliding Window approach

 A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems.
 A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. [i, j)
 [i,j) (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction.
 For example, if we slide [i, j)[i,j) to the right by 1 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1)

 a) Using Set
 Back to our problem. We use HashSet to store the characters in current window [i, j).
 Then we slide the index j to the right. If it is not in the HashSet, we slide j further. Doing so until s[j] is already
 in the HashSet. At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters start with index i.
 If we do this for all i, we get our answer

 Time complexity (with Hashset): O(2n) as we move i little by little, so traverse each char atmost twice

 b) Using Map
 The above solution requires at most 2n steps. In fact, it could be optimized to require only n steps.
 Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or not, we could define a mapping of the characters to its index.
 Then we can skip the characters immediately when we found a repeated character.

 Time complexity: O(n)

 Approach 2: (V.v.v. tricky : Understand this logic and write code)
    1. Lookup if a character exist in substring instantaneously using array to store characters that have appeared
    2. If previously character is not part of Substring (not found before) => update its position and increment length
    3. If it was part of Substring (found before), then our substring changes. It becomes substring
        starting from next character of previous instance to currently scanned character.
    4. Keep track of max length everytime and update if its greater.
