 * 11. Container With Most Water
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines
 * are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis
 * forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 *
 * Approach:
 1. Need to find max area between different lines.
 2. Keep 3 variables:
 maxArea = keeps track of max area found so far
 left = left index
 right = right index
 3. Scan from both sides. If leftHeight < rightHeight, move right and find a value that is greater than leftHeight.
 4. Similarly, if leftHeight > rightHeight, move left and find a value that is greater than rightHeight.
 5. Additionally, keep tracking the max value.

 Note: You may not slant the container.
