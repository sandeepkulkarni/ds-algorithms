/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/
 *
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 <= i <= num calculate the number of 1's in
 * their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n), possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

Hint:
You should make use of what you have produced already.
Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?

	/**
	 *  Improved Solution: 
	 * For number 2(10), 4(100), 8(1000), 16(10000), ..., the number of 1's is 1. 
	 * Any other number can be converted to be 2^m + x. 
	 * For example, 9=8+1, 10=8+2. The number of 1's for any other number is
	 *  1 + # of 1's in x.
     *---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Approach:
     * 1. Keep a results array from which we will resuse previous results
     * 2. If multiple of 2, then result[i] = 1. eg, 2,4,8,16
     *      Keep power variable to store next multiple of 2.
     *      Left shift power by 1 => multiply 2 and reset index for referring number from multiple of 2.
     *3. Else
     *      add 1 to previous result and increment index
     *
     *  Complexity: O(n) - we are reusing previously calculate result
